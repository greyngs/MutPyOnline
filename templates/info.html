                <p>From article at Wikipedia:</p>
                <p><b>Mutation testing</b> (or <i>mutation analysis or program mutation</i>) 
                    is used to design new software tests and evaluate the quality 
                    of existing software tests. Mutation testing involves modifying 
                    a program in small ways. Each mutated version is called a 
                    mutant and tests detect and reject mutants by causing the behavior 
                    of the original version to differ from the mutant. This is called 
                    killing the mutant. Test suites are measured by the percentage of 
                    mutants that they kill. New tests can be designed to kill 
                    additional mutants. Mutants are based on well-defined mutation 
                    operators that either mimic typical programming errors (such as 
                    using the wrong operator or variable name) or force the creation 
                    of valuable tests (such as dividing each expression by zero). The 
                    purpose is to help the tester develop effective tests or locate 
                    weaknesses in the test data used for the program or in sections of 
                    the code that are seldom or never accessed during execution. Mutation 
                    testing is a form of white-box testing.
